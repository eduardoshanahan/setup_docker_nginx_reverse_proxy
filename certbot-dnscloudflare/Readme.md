To make this container to work, you need to create a directory named 'cloudflare' and inside it you need a file called credentials.

The content of that file has to be:

dns_cloudflare_api_token="replace with your api token in cloudflare"

Once you ran it, a directory named 'letsencrypt' will be created and the content will include you keys, located at:

* './letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/fullchain.pem' 
* './letsencrypt/live/<yourdomain>/privkey.pem' 
* 
Later you can create symbolic links to include them into your Nginx configuration.
